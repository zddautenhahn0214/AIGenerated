*uses manim


I had the idea to use a python library called manim to create an animation of fractals that looked like flowers for mothers data, because I am a nerd. I've never used manim before so I asked chatGPT4 to assist me. I went back and forth with the AI many times trying to get it to produce the flowers how I wanted them to look and also to test how maluable and easy it would be to communicate with the AI. Like how a client needs to go back and forth with developers to get their vision fulfilled.

It turned out pretty good and my mom was happy and amused with it.
