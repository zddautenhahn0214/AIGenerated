Started this with the prompt to gpt4:
"
write a simple python program to play the game Mastermind
"

This worked on the first try, no gui and pretty bare bones, but it works as requested.

Next I wanted the AI to create a bot to play the game automatically, used the prompt:
"
now write a program that will learn how to play this game and optimize for fewest attempts
"

What I wanted was to eventually create a machine-learning algorithm that would learn different strategies to play the game. After going back and forth with the AI I think this task is too complex for it to complete on its own and that I would need to do more research and planning into how this learning algorithm would work in order to give proper prompts to the AI to get what I want from it.
Although it is interesting to note that working with the AI to create a machine learning algorithm can be a great way to learn more about how it all works since you can ask questions about everything that is going on and get mostly good answers on the basics. At the very least you can learn the important keywords to research more on your own later. Plus the practical and immediate application of the knowledge that is baked into the process is gratifying.
