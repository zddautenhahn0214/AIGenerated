this is a simple weather app to check the weather of a specified region.

this idea and code was generated by chatGPT, modified by me to actually work, just a some small details missed.

I also had the AI try to generate unit tests for the app, with mixed results. How to properly test code needs a little more creativity or guidence that this AI could give.
