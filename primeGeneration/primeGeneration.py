#saw a question on reddit asking how to write code that will generate a list of prime numbers within a lower and upper bound
#asked chatGPT to do it and see what happens


#To generate a list of prime numbers within a given range, we can use a variation of the sieve of Eratosthenes. Here's one way to do it in Python:
def generate_primes(lower_bound, upper_bound):
    # Create a list of all numbers in the specified range
    primes = list(range(lower_bound, upper_bound + 1))

    # 0 and 1 are not prime, so remove them from the list
    if 1 in primes:
        primes.remove(1)
    if 0 in primes:
        primes.remove(0)

    # For each number in the list, remove its multiples from the list
    for prime in primes:
        for multiple in range(prime * 2, upper_bound + 1, prime):
            if multiple in primes:
                primes.remove(multiple)

    return primes


#To use this function, you would call it with the desired lower and upper bounds, like this:

# Generate a list of primes between 0 and 100
primes = generate_primes(0, 100)

# Print the list of primes
print(primes)

#This should produce the following output:
#[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97]
