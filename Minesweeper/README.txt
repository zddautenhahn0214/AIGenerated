#asked chatGPT3: "write the game minesweeper in python"
Game works, though with minimal features, I had to ask for the AI to adda reset game button.

Then I had chatGPT3 write a bot to play the game for me, which sort of worked, but now I intended. It wrote a whole new program to simulate a game of minesweeper then had the bot 'play' that version and print if it won or lost. It only ever lost.
