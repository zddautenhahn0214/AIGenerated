This is a collection of programs that I had chatGPT3 generate from the 2021 sample contest questions from Seminole State College.
https://www.seminolestate.edu/computers/competition/samples/2021.

I also tried to get the AI to write me a program that would scrape the questions from the website, then ask cahtGPT3 for the solutions automatically.
Mixed results, chatGPT3 isnt quire up to the task on its own yet.

sorry this folder is a bit of a mess
